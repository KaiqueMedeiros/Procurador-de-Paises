# 🚀Country Finder🚀

## ⚙️ I used HTML for the website structure, along with Bootstrap for more efficient styling, and an API (REST Countries) to fetch the necessary data. JavaScript was used to build the functional logic of the application. ⚙️

### 📚 I was able to learn more about Bootstrap, which is a very interesting tool that saves a lot of time when it comes to styling websites! Consuming the API and handling its data through JavaScript gave me a multitude of ideas for future projects. The way it can be easily manipulated and applied to HTML using the DOM is truly amazing! 📚
